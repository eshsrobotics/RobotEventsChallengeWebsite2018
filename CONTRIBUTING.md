* As per the competition rules, the website must have been designed and programmed by students in our VRC program
* Do not commit to the master branch! Your changes may be reverted.
* All modifications must be made in a new branch, *do not commit to master branch*
* Follow branch naming similarly to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6065944/9367643), but replace slashes with '-'
  * Here are some examples of generalized valid branch names. If you're not sure whether to categorize it as a feature, bug, or junk, prefix it with `new`
  ```bash
  feat-new_feature
  bug-new_bug_fix
  junk-throwaway_branch_for_experimentation
  new-branch_unsure_categorization
  ```
