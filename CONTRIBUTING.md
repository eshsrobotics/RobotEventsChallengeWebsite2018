# Contributing
## Basics
* Do not commit to this repo directly and do not commit to the master branch!
* Rather, *fork this repo, and clone that*
* All modifications must be made in a new branch, *do not commit to master branch*
* Follow branch naming similarly to [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6065944/9367643), but replace slashes with '-'
  * Here are some examples of generalized valid branch names. If you're not sure whether to categorize it as a feature, bug, or junk, prefix it with `new`
  ```bash
  feat-new_feature
  bug-new_bug_fix
  junk-throwaway_branch_for_experimentation
  new-branch_unsure_categorization
  ```
  * You can follow branch naming loosely, the most important things are the first three bullet points
